            I have worked for the BYU Daily Universe for the past semester on the sports desk. I was assigned to cover BYU men's soccer as my beat throughout the semester.
            The majority of my coverage for the team was game summaries and previews during their season this semester, that ended with a conference and a national championship.

                    Beat: BYU men's soccer <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Beat Overview:</h4>
                    I primarily have done game recaps for the men's soccer team. They are an incredibly successful extramural team.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Major contacts for beat:</h4>
                    Brandon Gilliam (BYU men's soccer head coach): 801-735-7756 <br>
                    Tyler Staten (BYU men's soccer social media): 385-528-4043 <br>
                    Their social media is most active on Twitter, and it tends to be more accurate than their website:
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"href="https://twitter.com/byusoccer">BYU men's soccer twitter</a> 
                    <br>
                    If you need their stats, ask Tyler Staten to give you access to Ollie. It is the app they use for everything from team chat to stats.

                    <h4>Story Ideas:</h4>
                    
                    Easy Ideas:<br>
                    They will be doing a variety of training throughout the winter and summer that you could cover.<br>
                    They occasionally do other types of events, such as training camps.<br>
                    Next fall there will be a lot of games to do previews or recaps for.<br><br>
                    Longer Form Ideas:<br>
                    You could look into their alumni as they tend to have a lot of success in life.<br>
                    You could do a championship recap since they have won nationals 11 times.<br>

            <h4>BYU Promotional Video</h4>
        This video was created for my Communications 312 class. The purpose of the project
        was to learn to record audio properly with a studio microphone setup, as well as
        gather shots that matched to the script we were given to create a promotional video
        for Brigham Young University. <br>

        <h4>Taki Video</h4>
        This video was created for my Communications 312 class. The purpose of the project
        was to learn to use shot composition correctly. This meant using a wide shot first.
        Then going into a medium shot, and then three or more tight shots. After that sequence
        we were to start over. There was a small visual effect I added which was the smoke on the Taki.
        Finally, if you are wondering yes, we did actually microwave it and he actually ate the microwaved Taki.
        <br>2/10 would not recommend eating.
