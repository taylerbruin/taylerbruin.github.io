                This video was created for my Communications 312 class. The purpose of the project
                was to learn to use shot composition correctly. This meant using a wide shot first.
                Then going into a medium shot, and then three or more tight shots. After that sequence
                we were to start over. There was a small visual effect I added which was the smoke on the Taki.
                Finally, if you are wondering yes, we did actually microwave it and he actually ate the microwaved Taki.
                <br>2/10 would not recommend eating.
